## Introduction
### Overview   
This compiler stack is an extension of the DRP-AI Translator to the TVM backend. CPU and DRP-AI can work together for the inference processing of the AI models.

### Overview
To deploy the AI model to DRP-AI on the target board, you need to compile the model with DRP-AI TVM[^1] to generate Runtime Model Data (Compile).  
SDK generated from RZ/V Linux Package and DRP-AI Support Package is required to compile the model.  

After compiled the model, you need to copy the file to the target board (Deploy).  
You also need to copy the C++ inference application and DRP-AI TVM[^1] Runtime Library to run the AI model inference.
