## Introduction
### Overview   
This compiler stack is an extension of the DRP-AI Translator to the TVM backend. CPU and DRP-AI can work together for the inference processing of the AI models.

### Overview
To deploy the AI model to DRP-AI on the target board, you need to compile the model with DRP-AI TVM[^1] to generate Runtime Model Data (Compile).  
SDK generated from RZ/V Linux Package and DRP-AI Support Package is required to compile the model.  

After compiled the model, you need to copy the file to the target board (Deploy).  
You also need to copy the C++ inference application and DRP-AI TVM[^1] Runtime Library to run the AI model inference.

Following pages show the example to compile the ResNet18 model and run it on the target board.  

### Compile model with DRP-AI TVM[^1]  
Please see [Tutorial](./tutorials).  

### Run inference on board  
Please see [Application Example](./apps) page.  

## Sample Application  
To find more AI examples, please see [How-to](./how-to) page.

## Confirmed AI Model
If you want to know which models have been tested by Renesas, please refer to [Model List](./docs/Model_List.md).

## Support  
### Error List  
If error occurred at compile/runtime operation, please refer [error list](./docs/Error_List.md).  

### Tips  
[How-to](./how-to) page includes following explanation.  
- profilier;  
- validation between x86 and DRP-AI;  
- etc.
