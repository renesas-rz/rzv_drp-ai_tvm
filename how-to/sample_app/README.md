# AI Sample Application

## Overview
This page explains about the sample application for DRP-AI TVM[^1] that uses USB Camera as an input and transfer the result via HTTP to display on HTML.  
Sample application code and its execution environment are provided in this directory.  
This application is for RZ/V2MA Evaluation Board Kit.

## Compile the application
1. Prepare the SDK that includes following packages.
    1. libwebsockets and jansson  
    Please refer to "Compile DRP-AI Sample Application" in RZ/V2MA DRP-AI Sample Application Note provided in RZ/V2MA DRP-AI Support Package.  
    2. opencv  
    Pease refer to [How to install OpenCV to Linux Package](../../apps/README.md#how-to-install-opencv-to-linux-package).  

2. Use the SDK generated in 1 to compile the sample application.  
Please refer to [Application Example](../../apps/README.md#how-to-compile-the-application).  
Please make sure to change the SDK path to the one generated in 1.  

## Run the application
To run the application, please refer to the instruction for USB Camera HTTP version application in RZ/V2MA DRP-AI Sample Application Note provided in RZ/V2MA DRP-AI Support Package.  

## Application Specification
### Model Information
Please refer to [AI Sample Application](../README.md#ai-sample-application) for model information.

### Mode
User can select AI models and DRP-AI/CPU mode.  
Note that some models only supports DRP-AI mode.  

#### DRP-AI mode
Pre-processing and inference are processed on DRP-AI and CPU.  
Post-processing is processed on CPU.  

#### CPU mode
All processing runs on CPU.
