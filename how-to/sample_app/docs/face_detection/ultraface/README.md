## Processing Details
### DRP-AI mode
- Source Code: [tvm_drpai_ultraface.cpp](../../../src/recognize/ultraface/tvm_drpai_ultraface.cpp)  

Followings are processing details if user selected "UltraFace (DRP-AI)".  

#### Pre-processing
Pre-processing is done by DRP-AI Pre-processing Runtime, which allows following pre-processing on DRP-AI.  

| Function | Details |  
|:---|:---|  
|conv_yuv2rgb |Convert YUY2 to RGB.|  
|resize |Resize to 320x240.|  
|cast_to_fp16 | Cast data to FP16 for DRP-AI.|  
|normalize | Normalize pixel values with mean value 127 and scale factor 1.0/128.|  
|transpose | Transpose HWC to CHW order. |  
|cast_fp16_fp32 | Cast FP16 data to FP32 for DRP-AI TVM[^1] input.|  

#### Inference
The Object files `ultraface_onnx` is generated from ONNX Model Zoo pre-trained model as described in [Model Information](#model-information).  
Please refer to [Compile Tutorial](../../../../../tutorials) for more details on compiling model.

#### Post-processing
Post-processing is processed by CPU.
